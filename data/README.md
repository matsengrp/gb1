# GB1 Datasets  
Fitness and stability data on GB1 mutants pulled from 2 different studies:

**Olson et al. (2014)**
* Measured fitness of all GB1 single and double mutants as binding affinity to
IgG Fc.
* Downloaded as supplementary excel file

**Nisthal et al. (2019)**
* Constructed nearly every single mutant of GB1 and tested stability by measuring
a denaturation gradient
* Downloaded 'study data' from protabank.org, found under the ID gwoS2haU3
